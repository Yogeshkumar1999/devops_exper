to share the  code we need to use the git hub.
we need centralised scm system(source code mamnagement).
we call the code as the work space.
In  git we call it as repository.
ti upload it in git we need an account in git.
version control is the main part of the git hub uses.
we want to roll back.
seee the history and you can see all the version of te code in github
.earlier we have the centalised version cinroll system.
now we have the decentralise version control system.
git id decentralised and github is centralised the one.
linux kernel and git is created by same person.
git is the local version control.
by using thr local lan we can share the code with in th3 permises.
we need to say git ti track the changes to the file.
we have the stagging area.
git staus -s.
git log yogesh.txt
it will show the version of the code.
git add.
git commit -m "added the things".
commi id /version.
it will be in the local.
to sen it to the githud use the git push.
also many.
